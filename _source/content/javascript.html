    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    
    <p>JavaScript is the third major component of a web page. JavaScript code, when properly applied to a web page, enhances the overall user and browser-based experience through attaching to events and controlling the overall behavior layer.</p>

		<p>JavaScript has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years as powerful new browser implementations have finally empowered the creation of full on browser-based web applications. Additionally, careful use of JavaScript allows for full manipulation and control over the other two components of web page authoring, <a href="#markup">HTML Markup</a> and <a href="#css">CSS</a>. Today the structure of pages and the visual styles of pages can be manipulated real time without full web page refreshes.</p>
	
    <h2>Libraries</h2>
    
    <p class="normalize">We primarily develop new applications in <a href="http://api.jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, though we have expertise in plain JavaScript as well as all major modern javascript libraries.</p>

    <h2>Coding Principles</h2>
    
    <ul>
  		<li>99% of code should be housed in external javascript files. They should be included at the END of the BODY tag for maximum page performance.</li>
  		<li>Don't rely on the user-agent string. Do proper feature detection. (More at <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/detect.html">Dive Into HTML5: Detection</a> &amp; <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/">jQuery.support docs</a>)</li>
  		<li>Don't use document.write().</li>
  		<li>All Boolean variables should start with "is".
  			<figure class="preCode">Test for positive conditions</figure>
  			<pre><code>
isValid = (test.value >= 4 && test.success);
  			</code></pre>
  		</li>
  		<li>Name variables and functions logically: For example: <code>popUpWindowForAd</code> rather than <code>myWindow</code>.</li>
          <li>Don't manually minify. With the exception of the traditional <code>i</code>, etc. for <code>for</code> loops, variables should be long enough to be meaningful.</li>
  		<li>Documentation should follow <a href="http://www.naturaldocs.org/documenting.html">NaturalDocs</a> structure.</li>
  		<li>Constants or configuration variables (like animation durations, etc.) should be at the top of the file.</li>
  
  		<li>Strive to create functions which can be generalized, take parameters, and return values. This allows for substantial code reuse and, when combined with includes or external scripts, can reduce the overhead when scripts need to change. For example, instead of hard coding a pop-window with window size, options, and url, consider creating a function which takes size, url, and options as variables.
  		</li>
  		<li>Comment your code! It helps reduce time spent troubleshooting JavaScript functions.</li>
  		<li>Don't waste your time with <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code> comments surrounding your inline javascript, unless you care about Netscape 4.&nbsp;:)</li>
  		<li>Organize your code as an <a href="http://kaijaeger.com/articles/the-singleton-design-pattern-in-javascript.html">Object Literal/Singleton</a>, in the <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/">Module Pattern</a>, or as an <a href="http://mckoss.com/jscript/object.htm">Object with constructors</a>.</li>
  
  	  <li>Minimize global variables - the less globals you create, the better. Generally one, for your application namespace, is a good number. 
  			<figure class="preCode">When specifying any global variable, clearly identify it</figure>		
  			<pre><code>
window.globalVar = { ... }
  			</code></pre>
  		</li>
  	</ul>
  
  
  	<h3>White-space</h3>
  
  	<p>In general, the use of whitespace should follow longstanding English reading conventions. Such that, there will be one space after each comma and colon (and semi-colon where applicable), but no spaces immediately inside the right and left sides of parenthesis. In short, we advocate readability within reason. Additionally, braces should always appear on the same line as their preceding argument.</p>
  
  	<p>Consider the following examples of a JavaScript for-loop...</p>
  

  	<figure class="preCode">Correct</figure>
  	<pre><code>
for (var i = 0, j = arr.length; i < j; i++) {
	// Do something.
}
  	</code></pre>
  
  	<figure class="preCode">Incorrect</figure>
  	<pre><code>
for ( var i = 0, j = arr.length; i < j; i++ )
{
	// Do something.
}
  	</code></pre>
  
  	<figure class="preCode">Also incorrect</figure>
  	<pre><code>
for(var i=0,j=arr.length;i&lt;j;i++){
	// Do something.
}
  	</code></pre>
  
  
  	<h3>plugins.js and script.js</h3>
  
  	<p>Starting with H5BP we're presented with two files, plugins.js and script.js. This section outlines basic usage of these two files.</p>
  
  	<h4>plugins.js</h4>
  
  	<p>Plugins.js is meant to hold all of a sites plugin code. Instead of linking to many different files, we can improve performance by including plugin code directly in this one file. There can and should be exceptions to this usage. An extremely large plugin only used on one rarely visited page, for example, might be better off in a separate download, only accessed on the target page. Most of the time, however, it's safe to just paste in minified versions of all your plugins here for easy access. </p>
  
  	<p>Here's what an example file might looks like, including a small table of contents. This can serve as a handy guide for what plugins are in use, including URLs for documentation, rationale for use and the like.</p>
  
  	<pre><code>
/* PLUGIN DIRECTORY

  	<h4>Script.js</h4>
  
  	<p>Script.js is meant to hold your site or application code. Again, this isn't always the best solution as larger teams and or larger, more feature rich projects can really benefit from breaking out application code into module or feature specific files. For smaller sites, simpler applications, and initial prototyping, however, dropping your work into scripts.js makes sense.</p>
  
  	<p>A simplified example, using the <a href='http://paulirish.com/2009/markup-based-unobtrusive-comprehensive-dom-ready-execution/'>Markup-based unobtrusive comprehensive DOM-ready execution</a> pattern, might look something like the following:</p>
  
  	<pre><code>     
/* Name: Demo
Author: Demo King */
/*demo namespace*/
demo = {
 common : {
   init     : function(){
	   //initialize
   },
   finalize : function(){
	   //finalize
   },
   config : {
	   prop : "my value",
	   constant : "42"
   }
 },
 mapping : {
   init     : function(){
	   //create a map
   },
   geolocate    : function(){
	   //geolocation is cool
   },
   geocode : function(){
	   //look up an address or landmark
   },
   drawPolylines : function(){
	   //draw some lines on a map
   },
   placeMarker : function(){
	   //place markers on the map
   }
 }
}
  	</code></pre>


    <h2>Variables, ID &amp; Class</h2>
    
    <p>All JavaScript variables shall be written in either completely lowercase letter or camelCase. The one exception to this are Constructor functions, which are capitalized by tradition. All <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> declarations in CSS shall be written in only lowercase. Neither dashes nor underscores shall be used. </p>


  	<h3>Event Delegation</h3>
  
  	<p>When assigning unobtrusive event listeners, it is typically acceptable to assign the event listener directly to the element(s) which will trigger some resulting action. However, occasionally there may be multiple elements which match the criteria for which you are checking, and attaching event listeners to each one might negatively impact performance. In such cases you should use event delegation instead.</p>
  
  	<p>jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/delegate">delegate()</a> is preferred over <a href="http://api.jquery.com/live">live()</a> for performance reasons.</p>
  
  
  	<h3>Debugging</h3>
  
  	<p>Even with the best of validators, inevitably browser quirks will cause issues. There are several invaluable tools which will help to refine code integrity and loading speed. It is important that you have all of these tools available to you, despite the browser you primarily use for development. We recommend developing for Firefox and Safari first, then Google Chrome and Opera, with additional tweaks via conditional comments just for Internet Explorer. The following is a list of helpful debuggers and speed analyzers...</p>

    <h1>Accessibility</h1>
    
    <p>This is a rather broad subject, one that is apart of everything that goes into a web site. <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/" target="_blank">Accessibility</a> has to do with everything from how content is written to the structure of HTML markup, appearance and styling, progressive enhancement and graceful degradation, plus how semantic and meaningful your code is when it is read by browsers.</p>	
    <p>We bring people and brands together, like never before. It is important that we reach as many people possible to provide new and exciting 'like never before' experiences. Some areas to consider for better accessibility during the development of any project are:</p>

  	<ul>
  		<li>Markup and semantics</li>
  		<li>Usability of the interface, via keyboard and with JS disabled</li>
  		<li>Correct usage of tags, attributes and descriptions</li>
  		<li>Text content for all non-text content</li>
  		<li>Summary content for screen-readers</li>
  	</ul>
  
  	<p>These areas are all closely related so it can be easier to break them down based on project types. Here are some things that should be done to achieve an accessible web page:</p>
  
  	<h3>Skip Navigation</h3>
  
  	<p>If your site has navigation elements before the main content, provide a "Skip to main content" link for screen readers. This is a link that is usually hidden using CSS, but will be available to a screen reader to jump past the navigation and go straight to the content. Sometimes it can be helpful to include a skip link to the footer or sitemap.</p>
  
  	<pre><code>
  	.skipnav { text-align: left; }
  	.skipnav a {
  		position: absolute;
  		left: -10000px; 
  		width: 1px; 
  		height: 1px; 
  		overflow: hidden;
  	}
  	.skipnav a:focus, .skipnav a:active { 
  		position: static; 
  		left: 0; 
  		width: auto; 
  		height: auto; 
  		overflow: visible; 
  		text-decoration: underline;
  	}
  	</code></pre>
  
  	<pre><code>
  		<div class="skipnav">
  			<a href="#maincontent">Skip to main content</a>
  			<a href="#sitemap">Skip to footer site map</a>
  		</div>
  	</code></pre>
  
  	<h3>Tab Index</h3>
  
  	<p>The tab index of a document starts with the first link in the document and works through them all in the source order until the end. This is often unusable and counter-intuitive to how elements appear on screen. So ensure that the tabbing order of links and active elements is logical, by using the <code>tabindex</code> attribute. Form elements should be tabbed through in the order a user expects to complete it, not necessarily in the order of the tags in the HTML.</p>
  
  	<h3>Acronyms/Abbreviations</h3>
  
  	<p>If your content uses abbreviations or acronyms, they must be expanded using <code>abbr</code> and <code>acronym</code> tags</p>
  
  	<h3>Images.</h3>
  
  	<p>All images must have an <code>alt</code> attribute. Alt attributes should be meaningful and describe the contents of the picture. If the image is purely decorative, alt attributes should be marked as empty using <code>alt=""</code>. Don't put something like <code>alt="This image is for decoration only"</code> as it will be read by the screen-reader and is really annoying.</p>
  
  	<p>Do not use images for spacing or other similar effects. This should be done using CSS.</p>
  
  	<h3>Flash and Image Replacement</h3>
  
  	<p>Always use backup HTML content for flash. All promo images should use CSS-based image replacement instead of alt tags.</p>
  
  	<figure class="preCode">Fallback non-flash version:</figure>
  	<pre><code>
<a href="/nike/morethanagame/" id="morethan">
  <h4>Nike: More Than A Game</h4>
  <h5>Experience the movement and view apparel</h5>
</a>
  	</code></pre>
  
  	<br />
  	
  	<pre><code>
  		a#morethan { background:url(/promos/nikegame.jpg) no-repeat; width: 200px; height: 100px;
  					 text-indent: -999px; overflow:hidden; display:block; }
  	</code></pre>
  
  	<p>Having a fallback for flash and images will also improve SEO.</p>
  
  	<h3>Tables</h3>
  
  	<p>Tables should be used purely for tabular data. They should not be used for presentational or layout purposes. When using tables:</p>
  
  	<ul>
  		<li>Use the <code>th</code> element for table headers. If the headers themselves are abbreviated, use the <code>abbr</code> attribute to expand them.</li>
  		<li>For complex tables, use the <code>scope</code> attribute on table headers to indicate what they pertain to.</li>
  	</ul>
  
  	<h3>Color</h3>
  
  	<p>Use of color should fulfill the following:</p>
  
  	<ul>
  		<li>Text should be readable with high contrast. Either use a light background with dark text or vice-versa. Very light text on a light background is virtually impossible to read for most people, it can be even worse for those with color-blindness.</li>
  		<li>Do not use red and green together to make distinctions between key functionality - a small percentage of people will not be able to perceive the distinction.</li>
  	</ul>
  
  	<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html" target="_blank">WAI site contains a list of color-blindness tools</a> that let you see sites as people with different types of colorblindness would.</p>
  
  	<h3>JavaScript</h3>
  
  	<p>Pages should still be functional with JavaScript disabled. Applications should degrade gracefully, or when possible make use of <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills">cross-browser polyfills</a> to add functionality to older browsers to enable features that may not be supported.</p>
  
  	<h3>Section 508</h3>
  
  	<p>Interfaces developed by Devfacto should meet Section 508 standards.</p>
  
  	<ul>
  		<li><a href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12#Web">Section 508 Standards for intranet and internet information and applications</a>.</li>
  	</ul>
  
  	<h3>Accessibility Checklist</h3>
  
  	<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html">W3C checklist</a> of checkpoints for accessibility. Interfaces developed by Devfacto should meet Priority 1 guidelines - <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/#Guidelines">The WCAG 1.0 Guidelines</a>.</p>
